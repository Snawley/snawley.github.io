    <h1>This is my second review of the 1010 Tigao shoe by New Balance I bought in January 2021</h1>

    <p1>Breaking these shoes in was not fun. 
        A couple times I thought these shoes were simply not going to be the right shoes for my preferences because they felt very stiff and have an unusual sole shape. 
        As you can see, the walls of the cupsole ride fairly high up on the midsole or walls of the shoe. The sole contians two layers making it stiff but very spongey. 
        The outsole has wavy lines that create lateral break points in the outsole. This helps reduce the stiffness of the sole in a very pre-determined manner that, 
        interestingly enough, lends itself to a running motion. 
        Unfortunately the inadequate flexibility of the sole to respond to 
        all directions of a skate shoes frequent twisting and torquing results in a less board control delivered by the 1010. 

        That was my initual complaint during my first review of the 1010. Since then I have put these shoes through many tricks at many spots. 
        Number of lace-swaps (still counting): ~ 4. 
        I am blown away by how well these shoes have held up. They stiffness I complained about for the first 3 months of wearing this 
        have been replaced by praises of its durability. The soft rubber of the sole has become much more flexible as it wore down. In this state, these shoes are great!
